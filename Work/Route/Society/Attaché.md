Hello 

This is a post listing few possible use cases for this plugin I've been procrastinating to write for some time, yet here it is. Please note that I'm aware of other approaches and software achieving the same or better result. This post is just a catalogue of ideas how this plugin could be used.

<summary>Humorous preamble: Marrying filesystem after years of one night stands</summary>

![dangerous_proposal_by_naolito_d4r95s1.jpg](../../../_resources/dangerous_proposal_by_naolito_d4r95s1.jpg)

Let's face it, attachments in our notes are out of date. In fact, we know that and don't even care keep them "fresh". We know that editing an attachment in a note is cumbersome and doesn't quite work on mobile. 

We accepted long ago that nothing lasts forever and quietly gave up on long term relationships between our files and notes. They meet regularly, exchange a few nice sentences and go on with their life. 

Each of them has got its own organization and rituals. What can you do if they are so different? 

They've been growing apart for so long and each of them even got a lover. Notes flirt here and there with these pesky website clippings, and filesystem is always chatting with that chad dude calling himself a Cloud (yet we all know that he's just a bit distant douchebag  filesystem). Maybe they just not destined to be together? 

Well, introducing Polygamy! ***cough-cough***, oh, that's not right, um wrong meeting... What the heck... Jeffrey! I asked you to move this talk with my wife to another time! I don't care that she left me! Gosh, those amateurs...

I mean... um... Introducing Resource Replacement! üëèüëèüëè

With resource replacement we can tie ~~those bastards in the basement~~ filesystem and notes while allowing them to keep independent structure.

# Use cases
> Attachments ain't just files, they are idea illustrations and good ideas are always a subject of evolution

## Claim space back

So far, the main usage of this plugin - to streamline the process of photos quality reduction freeing up space on a cloud storage

It works like that:

- You install the plugin
- You write down the path of the folder in the plugin settings where you will save your new reduced in size files
- You copy your Joplin files in resource directory (`/.config/joplin/resources/`) to the path you wrote in the settings
- You use quality/size reducing tool of your choice to all file in that copied folder. Could be done with images in bulk via RawTherapee or Lightroom
- You click "Replace resources" from tool menu in Joplin
- Done, your new files are now in Joplin and will be synced with the cloud.

The advantages of this method:

- Works in bulk of any size
- Works with any file format
- Once setup you can run it multiple times: periodically (every sync) or until you get the result you need
- There's less risk messing data due to user error
